#  Multi-Agent System for Smart Traffic Management 

## Pitch

Have you ever wanted to run a red light or stop sign when no other cars are aroundâ€”safely? Well, now your autonomous car can. Instead of a world where traffic signals that alternate between red and green, they now spend most of their time yellow - a go ahead signal for autonomous vehicles to rely on local communication with other AVs to safely navigate through intersections and reduce traffic.
